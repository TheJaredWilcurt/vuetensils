**WIP: This component is still looking for more testers and some feedback.**

A date picker with accessibility baked in.

- [Source](https://github.com/AustinGil/vuetensils/blob/master/src/components/VDate/VDate.vue)

Features:
- Manages ARIA roles, labels, and attributes.
- Manages focus ring and traps focus within calendar.
- Provides keyboard navigation support (see below).
- Supports passing in min and max date props.

**Keyboard navigation:**

Key              | Action
:--              | :--
Enter/Spacebar   | Select the currently focused date and hide the calendar.
Right            | Move to next day.
Left             | Move to previous day.
Down             | Move to next week.
Up               | Move to previous week.
Home             | Move to beginning of week.
End              | Move to beginning of week.
PageUp           | Move to previous month.
Shift + PageUp   | Move to previous year.
PageDown         | Move to next month.
Shift + PageDown | Move to next year.
Esc              | Hide the calendar without selecting a date.

**NOTE:** I would probably recommend using the browser's [built in date picker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/date) (`<input type="date">`) because it's simpler, consistent across website, and it's less code. However, it does not support custom styling.

## Installation

```js
// main.js
import Vue from 'vue';
import { VDate } from 'vuetensils/src/components';

Vue.component('VDate', VDate);
```

import { VDate } from 'vuetensils/src/components';

export default {
  components: {
    VDate,
  },
  // ...
};
</script>
```

  data: () => ({
    date: new Date(),
  }),
};
</script>
